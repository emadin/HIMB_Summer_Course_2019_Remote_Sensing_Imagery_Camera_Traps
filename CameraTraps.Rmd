## Summary

This module focuses on low-cost using camera traps on coral reefs in the field to capture ecological and behavioral patterns that would bbe difficult to capture using traditional diver surveys or obbservations. 

## Goals

* Expose participants to camera traps (i.e., remote, in-situ observation) as a tool in marine science 
* Start thinking about ?s to ask/answer in their own research
* Provide coral reef field experience

## Components

* Devise/practice camera deployment protocol
* Measure reefs in-situ
* Measure reefs w/satellite imagery of various spatial resolutions via:
    + Google Earth
    + Planet Explorer
* Compare patterns and measurement variability based on method, imagery spatial resolution, etc.
* Write up results as 'mini-paper'

## Protocols

Each group of participants will focus on a unique set of patch reefs: 

* Group 1: Patch reefs (PR): 19 (small), 16 (med), 12 (large)
* Group 2: Patch reefs (PR): 20 (small), 22 (med), 15 (large)
* Group 3: Patch reefs (PR): 21 (small), 23 (med), 24 (large)

#### Part 1: Field measurements

Preparation:

* Brainstorm, plan, and practice measurements on land:
    + Area
    + Perimeter
* Revise plan and write protocol for field measurements
* Create datasheets on waterproof paper
* Gather remaining supplies for morning field trip

Measuring reefs:

* Measure each study reef based on methods in protocol
* Record data (including metadata - e.g., date/time, depth, etc.) on datasheet(s)
* Make sure not to leave any gear in the water!

Data entry:

* Open the .csv datasheet template ("Module1_MeasuringReefs_template.csv") sent to you by Slack
    + Do not add/delete columns since we will combine datasets later
    + Column headings in red are those you’ll be filling in
* Open .csv datasheet template and re-save with your initials appended to the end of the filename (e.g., "Module1_MeasuringReefs_EM.csv")
    + Column headings you’ll be filling in are:
        - reef_no
        - perimeter_m
        - area_m2
        - diam_longest_m (if measured)
        - diam_perpendic_m (if measured)
        - date 
        - observer (as your three or four initials)
        - notes (if needed)

* Enter data into this datasheet

#### Part 2: Imagery measurements

Getting started:

* Open .kmz/.kml patch reef placemark file ("Sites.kmz", sent to you by Slack) in Google Earth
* Open .csv datasheet you saved with your initials
    + Column headings you’ll be filling in are:
        - reef_no
        - perimeter_m
        - area_m2
        - observer (as your three or four initials)
        - notes (if needed)

Measuring reefs:

* You will measure three of the patch reefs in Kane’ohe Bay for:
    + Area
    + Perimeter
* Do one replicate of each reef
* If time permits, do the two additional replicate measurements per reef listed in datasheet
* You will use both Google Earth and Planet Explorer to measure reefs using imagery spanning a range of spatial resolutions

1) **Google Earth**

    + Measure each of the study reefs for the following dates/spatial resolutions by using the Time Slider to select the following dates’ imagery:
    

        Date (yyyymmdd)   | Resolution (m)  | Satellite                             | Provider     | 
        ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------ |
        20130115          | 0.15            | NA; aerial imagery                    | Unknown      |
        20130822          | 0.50            | WorldView-1/2, GeoEye-1, or Quickbird | DigitalGlobe |
        20110108          | ~1.00           | Ikonos                                | DigitalGlobe |
        20030412          | ~2.00           | EarlyBird-1 (?)                       | DigitalGlobe |


    + Use the polygon measurement tool to extract area/perimeter 
    + Manually copy measurements into .csv 
    + Save measurement: name as “PR## _ #.## _ ## _ ##” = PR[reef #] _ [resolution, in m] _ [replicate] _ [your initials] (e.g., “PR21_0.15_01_EM”)
    + Drag saved measurements to My Places
    + Frequently save My Places (File -> Save -> Save My Places)
    + _Note_: if you need to go back to measurements, right-click on outlines (or their corresponding saved names in My Places) -> Get Info 

2) **Planet Explorer**

    + Draw a rectangular AOI (area of interest) to cover Kane’ohe Bay
    + Visually compare the Google Earth placemarks with the Planet Explorer AOI to locate your study reefs 
    + Measure each of the study reefs for the following satellites/dates/spatial resolutions by using the left-hand options area to select the following imagery:

        Date (yyyymmdd)   | Resolution (m)  | Satellite                             | Provider     | 
        ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------ |
        20190316          | ~3.00           | PlanetScope (formerly Dove CubeSats)  | Planet       |
        20160208          | 5.00            | RapidEye                              | Planet       |
        20180307          | ~10.00          | Sentinel-2                            | ESA          |
        20190328          | 30.00           | Landsat 8                             | USGS         |

    + To find this imagery most efficiently, set the following search parameters:
        - Make sure you’re in “Browse” mode 
        - Date range (right under search box) = 2016/01/01 - today
        - Drop down menu = Daily imagery
        - Cloud cover = 0-10%
        - Area coverage = 0-90%
        - Source = tick sources corresponding to “satellite” above 
        - _Tip_: do this satellite by satellite for faster searching
    + Use the “measure area” tool to extract area 
    + Use the “measure distance” tool to extract perimeter (hold shift for free hand measurement of both area/perim)
    + Manually copy measurements into .csv 
    + _Note_: there’s no way to save measurements, so double-check each entry for accuracy before moving on

## Part 3: Data analysis

Once all data is collected: 

* Check your dataset for any typos, missing values, etc.
* Create a new RStudio proejct (.Rpoj) in the same folder as your .csv
* Creat a new project-specific repository in Github 
* Link your Github repo with your project directory (folder)
* Commit/push to a new project-specific repository you create in Github
* Send your repo's link to the rest of the group via our Slack rotation group channel
* Pull (download) everyone else’s datasets
* Merge others’ datasets with your dataset
* Commit/push revised (merged) dataset to your Github repo

Once everyone’s data is merged:

* Create a new R Markdown (.Rmd) file in R Studio
* Make some basic plots to help you explore any patterns in the data
* Run some statistical analyses to determine sources of variance, any significant trends, etc. 

Now, let's do some basic plots to get you started:

_Note: you'll need to change the data source file path & file name to match your own, and your results will be different as a result._ 

```{r data import, echo=TRUE, results='hide', include=FALSE}
################################################
# import data, observe structure
################################################

data<-read.csv("data/Module1_MeasuringReefs_EM.csv", header = TRUE)

names(data)
head(data)
data$year<-substr(data$date,0,4) # add a column for year only
```


```{r data explore-1, echo=TRUE, results='hide', fig.height=5, fig.width=5, fig.align='center'}

################################################
# explore patterns
################################################

# Effect of method
plot(area_m2~method, data=data, na.ignore=TRUE, col="lightgrey",
     ylab="Patch reef area (m^2)", 
     xlab="Method", 
     main="Area versus method")
dev.copy(pdf,"figs/method_area_effect.pdf")    # can change to .png, etc.; can change size to incr resolution
dev.off()

# Effect of imagery resolution
plot(area_m2~imagery_resolution_m, data=data, col="slategrey",
     xlim=c(0,10),
     xlab="Imagery spatial resolution (m)", 
     ylab="Patch reef area (m^2)", 
     main="Area versus imagery resolution")
res.area.lm=lm(area_m2 ~ imagery_resolution_m, data=data)
abline(res.area.lm, col = "black")
summary(res.area.lm)
dev.copy(pdf,"figs/resolution_area_effect.pdf")    
dev.off()

plot(perimeter_m~imagery_resolution_m, data=data, col="slategrey",
     xlim=c(0,10),
     xlab="Imagery spatial resolution (m)", 
     ylab="Patch reef perimeter (m)", 
     main="Perimeter versus imagery resolution")
res.perim.lm=lm(perimeter_m ~ imagery_resolution_m, data=data)
abline(res.perim.lm, col = "black")
summary(res.perim.lm)
dev.copy(pdf,"figs/resolution_perimeter_effect.pdf")    
dev.off()

# Effect of date (i.e., do patch reefs measureably grow or shrink over time?)
plot(area_m2~as.numeric(year), data=data, col="slategrey",
     xlab="Year", 
     ylab="Patch reef area (m^2)", 
     main="Area versus year")
date.area.lm=lm(area_m2 ~ as.numeric(year), data=data)
abline(date.area.lm, col = "black")
summary(date.area.lm)
dev.copy(pdf,"figs/date_area_effect.pdf")    
dev.off()
```

Now, let's see if there's anything going on with time when imagery resolution is considered:

```{r data analysis-1, echo=TRUE, results='hide', fig.height=5, fig.width=5, fig.align='center'}
################################################
# analyze data
################################################

# Effects of imagery resolution + year
res.year.lm=lm(area_m2 ~ imagery_resolution_m * as.numeric(year), data=data)
summary(res.year.lm)
```

Or reef identity (number):

```{r data analysis-2, echo=TRUE, results='hide', fig.height=5, fig.width=5, fig.align='center'}
################################################
# analyze data
################################################

# Effects of imagery resolution + reef ID
res.reefID.lm=lm(area_m2 ~ imagery_resolution_m * reef_no, data=data)
summary(res.reefID.lm)
```


## Part IV: Write-up

* When you’re finished with your analyses, go back and give each figure a short caption 
* Structure your .Rmd file as a ‘mini-paper’ with a bit of very brief text (~2-5 sentences) for each of the usual paper sections: 
    + Introduction (summarize what you’re doing with this mini-project)
    + Methods (what you did, both in the field and the lab)
    + Results (here’s where your figures and stats outputs will go)
    + Discussion (mention any interesting findings and, if you have time, briefly relate this to any previous literature using a similar approach/asking similar questions)	
* This exercise will help you see the value of using R Markdown to write papers (if you’re not already familiar with or using it)
